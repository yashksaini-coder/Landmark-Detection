# Landmark-Detection

Landmark Detection detects popular natural and human-made structures within an image.

## Project Description

The Landmark Detection application is designed to identify and classify popular natural and human-made structures within an image. It uses a TensorFlow model to perform the classification and provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing the classification results.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yashksaini-coder/Landmark-Detection.git
    cd Landmark-Detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage Instructions

To use the Landmark Detection application, follow these steps:

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Upload an image by clicking on the "Choose an image..." button.

4. Once the image is uploaded, click on the "Classify Image" button to classify the image and view the results.
